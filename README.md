# `learn`
This repo has been rendered for the initial purpose of introducing Arend M. W. to the coding world.

## SETUP!

## Step 1!
- Make sure `git` is installed
```sh
## make sure u have homebrew: 
# /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install git
```

## Step 2!
- Install & setup Python3 (the right way)

```sh
python -V # check the version
```

- I recommend `pyenv`...
```sh
brew install pyenv
pyenv install 3.8.7
pyenv global 3.8.7
pip install ipython # source ~/.bash_profile
```

## Step 3!
- Install & setup your IDE(s)/Text editor(s)/etc...
    + VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
    + Jupyter
    ```sh
    pip install jupyterlab
    ```

### Using `git`!
- Clone this repository
- Commit, push, and pull changes!


### Step 2!
#### Predict someone's gender from their name (using `Python`)
- Look into `Python` machine learning classification algorithms, install the relevant packages, get familiar with hyperparameters
- Train a basic model (with data provided by Sam). Explore its accuracy. Test it on some names.
- Try grid searching or randomized hyperparameter tuning (hint: `GridSearchCV` & `RandomSearchCV`)
- Also consider different ways of pre-processing your data & feature engineering before training some models (hint: `CountVectorizer` can be helpful!)

### Step 3!
- TBD... stay tuned!!
