This repo has been rendered for the initial purpose of introducing Arend M. W. to the coding world.

## Step 1!
### Using `git`!
- Clone this repository
- Commit, push, and pull changes!


## Step 2!
### Predict someone's gender from their name (using `Python`)
- Look into `Python` machine learning classification algorithms, install the relevant packages, get familiar with hyperparameters
- Train a basic model (with data provided by Sam). Explore its accuracy. Test it on some names.
- Try grid searching or randomized hyperparameter tuning (hint: `GridSearchCV` & `RandomSearchCV`)
- Also consider different ways of pre-processing your data & feature engineering before training some models (hint: `CountVectorizer` can be helpful!)

## Step 3!
- TBD... stay tuned!!
