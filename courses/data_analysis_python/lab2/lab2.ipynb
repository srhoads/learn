I'm using this dataset because it aligns with my personal research interests and I wanted to make this lab as utilitarian as possible! It's data from a UK-based retailer. Each observation (row) of the data corresponds to one sale. The data has price of item, quantity sold in each individual purchase transaction, country of sale, and description of item. I'm focusing on the description of the items and recoding that text variable into more useful categorical variables (explained below)."

    "### - Additional recoding (not totally relevant to the Qs in the lab): - <code>material</code> and <code>continent</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I'm recoding some variables/creating new ones below! I'm also filtering the data so that it only has the observations we care about (valid UnitPrices and valid Quantity sold for each given transation). My new  <code>material</code> categorical variable is derived from the Description column. I pulled out possible materials from the descriptions of the items sold. I'll summarize them below.\n",
    "##### I'm recoding a new variable called <code>continent</code> from the current Country variable. This will help us get a narrowed down data set of georaphies so as to really analyze the material purchased based off geographical region. I'm recoding the country variable as a new variable (continent for example) by using a python package called pycountry_convert and looping through each class in our Country variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### For curiority's sake, I created a few other categorical variables from the description column too (but I won't focus on them for this lab). I extracted item color, base item object, and whether the items is meant for children or not. All of these derived variables are first-drafts just for identifying initial patterns in the data. They're not perfect, but they're helpful for this exercise!"

    "## Interpretation for regression 1 (Quantity~invoice_month):\n",
    "#### Interesting! Later in the year (the greater the invoice month), the lower the quantity of item purchase, on average (marginally significant: p=.07). Colloquially, this means that as the year progresses, people are buying fewer duplicates of items. You can see the code output in the regression below called <code>Quantity~invoice_month</code>. \n",
    "#### - **Specific interpretation**: for each **_month_** increase in the **_year_**, on average, the **_quantity of items purchased in a given transaction_** is **_marginally statistically significantly (p=.07) lower_** by **_0.1109 (coefficient=-0.1109)_**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - **More discussion**: Perhaps this is because people tend to stock up early in the year? I bet there are peaks and valleys in the trend based on specific months with consumer-oriented holidays. This linear regression doesn't account for that, but it'd be an interesting concept to investigate. For example, maybe November has significantly higher sales than other months because of Black Friday, even though it's late in the year. For curiosity's sake, I'm investigating this concept below. Spoiler alert: November doesn't have statistically significantly more sales than the rest of the months. In fact, compared to November, the months of January (coef=2.3374, p=.02), August (coef=3.0555, p=.002), and September (coef=2.4254, p=.006) all have statstically significantly higher purchase quantities. This kinda debunks my hypothesis of November being a high-quantity-of-item-per-transaction-purchasing-month. You can see the output of this regression in the summary a few cells below for the regression called: <code>Quantity~C(invoice_month_str, Treatment(reference=\"11\"))</code>\n",

    "## Interpretation for regression 2 (Quantity~invoice_month):\n",
    "#### The following regression is kind of boring, so I'm not analyzing it as my primary example. Essentially, it's saying that items purchased in a higher quantity (in a single transaction) are, on average, cheaper than items purchased in smaller quantities. An example of this could be purchasing beers versus diamond rings. Beers are cheaper and more likely to be purchased in multiple-quantities than are diamond rings. Typically, individual retail shoppers will purchase one diamond ring in one trip to the store for some special occassion, like a wedding. I find this regression a little dull because it's SO intuitive. Thus, I'm analyzing it, but not giving it the full attention of this lab. The p-value is specifically .005, which is lower than the threshold of .05, so we have a significant relationship.\n",
    "#### - **Specific interpretation**: for each **_dollar_** increase in the **_unit price_**, on average, the **_quantity of items per purchase/transaction_** is **_statistically significantly (p<.05) lower_** by **_.0009 (coefficient=-.0009)_**.\n",
