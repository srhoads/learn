    "Reading data below! We're using our own custom dataset (not the GSS data!). I found this sample retail sales dataset at this link: #https://www.kaggle.com/carrie1/ecommerce-data. I'm using this dataset because it aligns with my personal research interests and I wanted to make this lab as utilitarian as possible! It's data from a UK-based retailer. Each observation (row) of the data corresponds to one sale. The data has price of item, quantity sold in each individual purchase transaction, country of sale, and description of item. I'm focusing on the description of the items and recoding that text variable into more useful categorical variables (explained below)."

It's nominal-ish because each class theoretically belongs to a consecutive month category, ie: January=1, Feb=2, Mar=3, Apr=4, ..., Nov=11, Dec=12. This variable will let us examine trends as the year progresses, but it's making the analysis simpler for us because it's ideologically binning continuous time into nominal months.\n",

I'm extracting just the number of words in the description. I'm wondering if longer/more verbose descriptions may be associated with any sales trends. By extracting the number of words in each description, we have a simple but useful heuristic for verbosity of item-description.\n",

I'm also filtering the data so that it only has the observations we care about (valid UnitPrices and valid Quantity sold for each given transation). My new material categorical variable is derived from the Description column. I pulled out possible materials from the descriptions of the items sold. I'll summarize them below.\n",
    "- I'm recoding a new variable called continent from the current Country variable. This will help us get a narrowed down data set of georaphies so as to really analyze the material purchased based off geographical region. I'm recoding the country variable as a new variable (continent for example) by using a python package called pycountry_convert and looping through each class in our Country variable.\n",
    "- For curiority's sake, I created a few other categorical variables from the description column too (but I won't focus on them for this lab). I extracted item color, base item object, and whether the items is meant for children or not. All of these derived variables are first-drafts just for identifying initial patterns in the data. They're not perfect, but they're helpful for this exercise!"

I'll use the toilet paper example again. A 10-pack of toilet paper (bulk) would logically be more expensive than a single roll of toilet paper would be, even though the ratio of price to subunit (roll) is probably lower for the bulk-pack. Sadly, we don't have a way to control for whether different retail items in our dataset come in different sized sets. Therefore, we'll likely see confounds/noise in our results. "

This regression is notable because the addition of the invoice_month variable nullified the effect of bulk_item_indicator on Quantity. It's not non-significant (p=.407). In the future, it'd be useful to delve further into this phenomenon and see what it is about invoice month that impacts Quantity of items purchased when we're controlling for the bulk_item_indicator class. Maybe the month predictor isn't totally linear. Maybe prices go up and down as the year progresses, in a different type of interval pattern."

Maybe some countries have different tariff laws on certain types of goods that others don't have. Further continents might be harder to ship to at all, so they wouldn't want to ship too many of each item. For the sake of brevity, I'm going to use my custom-encoded continent variable, as opposed to the original Country variable, because Country just has far too many classes to analyze for the purpose of this lab. Thus, we should note that I might be making unfair generalizations about countries in the same continents having similar tariff laws or customs. Like I alluded to, maybe shipping costs end up factoring into the Quantities, which could suggest that customers far from the retailer's UK location might have to pay more for the same products, so they don't buy them at such high quantities.\n",

    "### It seems like item Quantities per purchase for Oceania have the most alarming results: they're statistically significantly much higher than they are for the other continents. This is contrary to my hypothesis. Maybe places like Oceania actually like to buy high quantities of items at once in order to stock up a lot since they probably won't want to do another super far shipment again later. Oceania is far and rather remote, with small scattered islands. (\\$49.13 more than when the continent isn't OC; p<.001)\n",
    "\n",
    "### - When adding the continent dummy variables to the model, our bulk_item_indicator predictor no longer has a statistically significant impact on Quantity of items per purchase. (p=.824; coef=.037), meaning bulk/multipack items don't seem to be purchased at different quantities than non-bulk items. This also makes my Oceania, far-away continent idea crumble a bit.\n",
    "### - The rest of the continent dummies have unexpected results too: Asia (which is far from the UK) also sees higher Quantities per unit in transaction on average (4.13), regardless of whether it's a bulk item or not, and regardless of purchase-month. The Americas also see some lower Quantities of items per purchase, but NOT statistically significantly.\n",
    "### - Unforeseen, the EU has stat. signif lower Quantities of item per purchase than other continents (by 11.78; p<.001). This might make sense because the company is in the EU, so selling to EU customers is likely cheaper/easier to deal with more transactions and customers probably come back a lot to buy more instead of stocking up super heavy in one sitting. Maybe there are also a variety of trade-related + logistical reasons. However, when controlling for the continent of purchase, the higher the purchase month (the later it is in the year) the lower is the Quantity of items per purchase on average by .07 (p<.001)."
